# mim_python_assignment


This repository contains code for Niklas' assignment: Jack Sparrow's Treasury Hunt!

The assignment description an be found in documentation > MiM Python Group Assignment 2021.pdf

For prototyping jupyter notebooks are used (folder notebooks).

The final assignment file is the ```jack_sparrow_treasury_hunt.py```.

## The labyrinth

![drawing](./assets/game_labyrinth.svg "Game Labyrinth")

This picture shows the labyrinth of the game with the different rooms.

Further the ```assets``` folder contains images of the rooms e.g.

![drawing](./assets/captains_cabin.png "Captains Cabin")

That are dsplayed when looking into the room.

And images for objects e.g.

![drawing](./assets/rum.png "Rum")

that are displayed in the inventory, and can be picked.

Additionally, I thought of one cool feature that needs to be implemented,
the asset
![drawing](./assets/map.png "Map")

contains the boat plan, and one could always have a look at the map and see his own position or something like that.

These visualizations need to be implemented.
